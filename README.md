# MorvyBlox
A simplified microblock system made specifically for decoration and easy tool support.

THIS PROJECT IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR MULTIPART. IT WILL NOT ALLOW PIPES AND OTHER FUNCTIONAL PARTS. IT IS ONLY FOR BUILDING PRETTIES.

Inspired by Morvelaira's exacting standards for construction tools and... *slight* obsession with microparts for building, MorvyBlox aims to be a micropart system which DOES NOT allow functional blocks such as pipes to be part of its structure. 

This should keep things simple and allow it to be more flexible than FMP for building and *much* easier to make tools work with it (such as the BuildCraft builder, Extra Utilities builder's wand, etc.)

Main aims:
- It should be easy to make tools which work with MorvyBlox. Rotation and mirroring will be handled and easily accessible.
- A wide range of materials. Because it will be using normal cubic blocks, it should be easy to detect usable materials dynamically.
- Just for building. This widens the available blocks to build with, since functionality doesn't have to be preserved.
